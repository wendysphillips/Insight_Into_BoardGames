81,"Battlestar Galactica is an incredible game. It really captures the spirit of the show. After a few turns, paranoia kicks in and everybody looks like a treacherous cylon.

I dislike most hidden role games because during the first turns players start making blind accusations simply to keep the game moving, because the game is just that. However, in BSG the game is already a worthy opponent so for the first turns there may be no need to accuse anybody because maybe nobody earnt that accusation. It is not until someone starts behaving suspiciously that players need to start accusing and sending characters to the brig.

But not only the hidden role mechanic is well done, on top of that there is a very good game of resource management with a bit of space combat and politics.

There are only two downsides to this amazing game: it needs at least 5 players to really have an interesting game and it runs very long.

The silver lining is that unlike many modern games, it plays fantastically well with 5 players, and more with expansions.",YIBcOZqGkI,4,Battlestar...,deduction

The different factions all have their own unique abilities which make for a different game each play, also combined with the random player board, which calls for a different strategy each play.People looking for a heavy combat game will be dissapointed, as combat is minimal in the game, however the threat of combat is constant, which, in my view, works very well.I've tried a few games against the AI on easy (Autometta) and normal (Automata) level and that's also a nice experience, which allows you experiment a bit with the combinations and strategies.

209,"Collector's Edition. Awesome game! I played it four times in the first week I owned it which I have never done with a big game before. Even my wife loves it and she doesn't really care for complex games with a lot of rules. This one hits the sweet spot between accessibility and complexity. I certainly wouldn't call it a gateway game but I could definitely see teaching it to and playing it with anyone that could handle games like Catan, Small World and Lords of Waterdeep.

This is my favorite game of 2016 and the best game/value that I have Kickstarted. It's early to call, but this game is almost certainly destined for my top five. This is the example that game publishers should be striving for in terms of components, rulebook, iconography, art, ease of access, replayability, accessibility and value.

Our first three-player game took three hours but our next two with the same players took only an hour and a half each (we played them back-to-back, it's that good). Turns are near simultaneous with three players, so there is very little downtime.

The game is very intuitive and after the first few turns, you know what to do and how most things work. From that point on, it's a matter of learning how to optimize your actions and developing an overall strategy.

There are five asymmetrical factions, each with their own special abilities. There are also five different player mats that have the same abilities but with slightly different costs and benefits. Each game you play, you get a different combination of these. Then you add in different secret objectives, different factory abilities and different end game bonuses for buildings and you get a heck of a lot of replayability.

If I had a complaint (and I don't) it would be that there isn't a whole lot of player interaction during the game. The board is big enough that you can pretty much do your own thing in your own corner of the map without much interference. I am sure in four or five player games there is a lot more interaction as players jostle for resources and space.

Super game! If you like worker placement and area control, you should love this one!

And I LOVE IT!! 

This game is all about efficiency and posturing. With the threat of war. It has a very ominous vibe throughout the whole game. 

I think people see mechs and think that this is all about dudes on a map and combat. If you go in with that attitude you will be very disappointed. This game is about building an engine and managing resources. You need to try your best to figure out which 6 stars you will be going for and then go. It might very well be that combat and area control will be a path to your victory or it might be setting up an engine of pumping out tons of resources and avoiding all combat as much as possible.

As far as calling a game a 4x or not. I hate how people can get so riled up over terms. I don't care if it fits into that ""box"" or not. I think the game does an excellent job of giving you the feeling of a 4x game all within a shorter time. (a hour and a half) For me that's why I often prefer to play Scythe over those other games.

However, from a gameplay perspective some of aspects fall a bit short. For instance, the early game is incredibly limiting, and players fall into scripted openings. And though I enjoy the star-based end game trigger, it appears that a few are more or less mandatory. Completing secret objectives, and winning a battle, are much easier to accomplish than maxing out the power or popularity tracks. All together, the decision space appears to be bigger than it really is. The biggest win here, surprisingly to me, is the world building.

472,"Theme/Art:
Scythe is the most beautiful game I own. Jakub Rozalski is an amazing artist and the art is 11/10, if not more.  Same goes for the theme as the game sets place in an alternative history in the 1920s where countries build giant battle mechs.

Production quality:
Amazing production quality, the board has 2 sides with one having a bigger map so you have more space for resources (you need to purchase a board extension to use it), the miniatures are very good, and every faction has different worker meeples, which is a nice touch. Nothing feels cheap in Scythe.

Replayability:
There are 5 factions with different abilities and different starting resources and also 5 player mats with different top and bottom rows, as well as different action costs. So you have to take a different approach each game, even if you play the same faction twice.

Depth/Difficulty:
The game takes a bit to explain, but it is actually not that hard and once you get the hang of it it has a nice flow. Since everybody only takes one top row action and maybe a bottom one on his turn, you don't have to wait long until you are up again.
The game has very interesting mechanics, especially how the game ends. Once someone placed all their 6 stars it's over. So if you are ahead and only have one star to place you can end the game immediately, but if you are behind in money you can drag the game out by not placing your last star (unless someone else places all their stars of course).
The fact that you don't get resources you produced into your supply, but they are placed on the hex they are produced on, is also very interesting, because you can steal resources from others if they don't watch out.
I also like that the encounter cards have no text on them (aside from your options), but only a picture of the scene, so you have to interpret it in your own way.
I weight it 3/5.

Strategy:
Scythe is a strategy game, so of course their is a lot of strategy involved. Your strategy should depend on your faction, player mat, and starting position. There are 10 ways to plays stars, but you only need to place 6 to end the game, so focus on 6 of those ways. E.g. if you draw shitty objectives, ignore them.
Oh, and get your popularity up to at least 13, you need it for the scoring!

Luck:
Aside from your starting setup (faction and player mat) and the cards you draw (encounters, objectives, factory cards) there is no luck involved. Even combat is not luck, but using power and power cards (and knowing how much power your enemy will spend.

Scythe takes about 80-150 minutes to play, depending on player count and how familiar players are with the game. Teaching the rules takes about 20 minutes.

In summary I like Scythe very much and it is the best looking game I own at the moment. We will see if its rating stays that high after a few more plays.",yqR4PtpO8X,3,Theme/Art:...,territory

I'm not sure there's really much here in the way of gameplay, either tactically or strategically: while moving your armies, there seems to be either a blindingly obvious best move, or several identical moves; the only decision you actually make in this game is which opponent to mess with.

This means three things.  First, since there are no real decisions to make, combat is dull.  Second, there is a big gang-up-on-whoever-is-winning factor, since there's no real way to deter attacks against your opponents aside from creating a wall of guys at your frontiers, Risk-style (and, again Risk-style, an opponent can break through and gobble up your delicious unprotected interior).  Third, since there is also a significant difference in the power levels of the various races and race qualities, there's a big luck factor involved, with the player who happens to be ready to decline when Ghouls or Sorcerers are in the mix in much better shape than the guy who is seeing Dwarves and Wizards (who are boring as well as awful!)

Players take on the role of an eponymous spirit, wielding spooky powers to help the native Dahan population (read: Mushroom People) turn back the invaders and the blight they bring with them. A turn is broken into several phases. First, players choose a growth action and pay for the cards they will use this round. Second, players enact fast power cards and take any innate actions if possible. Third, invaders ravage while the MP fight back, and then the invaders build and explore. Fourth, players enact slow power cards and take any innate actions if possible. And, finally, there is a clean-up phase. The game continues until the spirits win by achieving their fear-level objectives, or the invaders win by exhausting the terrain deck, placing all their blight on the island, or by completely killing off one of the spirits.

THOUGHTS
Kudos to Eric Reuss for not only making a heavy cooperative game but also a cooperative game that eliminates the QB problem many of these games suffer from. There were moments when players said, “This is clearly the best move.” But, overall, there is so much to process that it would be difficult and cumbersome for a player to direct another player’s action. The main action of the game happens via your personal deck, and the powers are nuanced enough that even playing the same spirit several times would not get old. 
All that said, I can see why people enjoy SI but I don’t think it’s for me. First, I don’t care for the aesthetic or table presence of the game. The beginner side of the tiles, while easy to parse, looks like a prototype, and the invader pieces feel a little cheap. Second, the game is just too long. At the beginning of each round, we parse what we want to do, calculating energy, choosing our cards, and thinking about the icons we need for our innate powers (or whatever they are). Then we talk about the board state. Can you deal with this here? I got this area. But, oh wait, your power sets you up to deal with them. I guess I could direct this card here but that feels like overkill. Maybe I’ll just push an MP this round and save up for next when mountains are ravaged. There is so much information to parse, I end up losing the thread of my initial plans, which forces me to start all over. It’s solitary and quiet, it’s frustrating, and it’s looong. Some people might like the puzzley nature of SI as well as the deep dive you can take into getting better with a spirit and the different cards but, man, that is so far from what I am interested in. SI is a unique design but a hard pass for me. 
I’ll give SI a rating of six (“Ok – will play if in the mood”) because I think it’s a clever design but I certainly will actively look to play something else if possible.",kPDxpJZ8PD,3,"GAMEPLAY

:d6-3: not super interested in expansion- possible but not needed-need to try first
:d6-4: :heart::arrowS: keeper value: I bought it to bring to the family game night and so far haven’t really played it, but one time. 
:d6-5: Similar to in my collection: Carcassonne, Between Two Cities, Kingdomiono is lighter so in some contexts better. 
:d6-6: solo mode not worth inventing 

:jug:   I liked it when I played it but I don’t think I will ever want to play it more than once, won’t usually go for it. But can play with kids so it’s value is great for family games nights

The amount of table space it consumes, the number of pieces you have to place, and the way some of the objectives play out are less than ideal; though having a large number of survivor and zombie standees on the table does look rather cool. This game isn't really a zombie game so much as it's a hidden role game with zombies. They aren't really more than an inconvenience that must be dealt with while accomplishing other goals, and the interaction of the players and the constant tension of never knowing who to fully trust is the real core of the game. While I've quite enjoyed each of the times I've played this game (anywhere from 2 to 5 players) it's simply not something that every gets requested to be brought to the table. I feel bad because it sits in my closet and never gets touched, despite everyone having enjoyed playing it when we have. Our group just tends to lean on Battlestar Galactica if we want a hidden role game, and a theme that actually enhances the gameplay rather than simply sort of existing around it.

I love both. The art is really good and the theme very immersive. It surprised me how dark the game is, some crossroads cards are really intense with cruel decisions to make.

Production quality:
No miniatures (but none needed), all standees and lots of token. The location cards could be thicker, but aside from the it's very good.

Replayability:
There are many crossroads cards, different personal goals, different team goals, different crises, etc. so replayablity should be no problem.

Depth/Difficulty:
It takes a bit to explain and to get all of it, but it's not the heaviest game I own. I weight it a 3/5.

Strategy:
Depending on you being the traitor or now you have to plan your steps. You have to avert crises, achieve your personal goal, and also achieving the team goal. And you have to kill zombies. A lot.

Luck:
There are dice involved and the crossroads cards are random and you don't know the trigger, but it's not too much dependent on luck for my taste.

Dead of Winter is a great game and depending on the mission takes between 30 and 180 minutes to play.

I really like the crossroads mechanism and the dark theme and if you like zombies, I recommend getting the game.

Sure that may be considered as poor play, but sometimes it just looks like a player got lucky and managed to grab a tile that gave them a bunch of very cheap points.

19900,"Battlestar Galactica is an incredible game. It really captures the spirit of the show. After a few turns, paranoia kicks in and everybody looks like a treacherous cylon.

I dislike most hidden role games because during the first turns players start making blind accusations simply to keep the game moving, because the game is just that. However, in BSG the game is already a worthy opponent so for the first turns there may be no need to accuse anybody because maybe nobody earnt that accusation. It is not until someone starts behaving suspiciously that players need to start accusing and sending characters to the brig.

But not only the hidden role mechanic is well done, on top of that there is a very good game of resource management with a bit of space combat and politics.

There are only two downsides to this amazing game: it needs at least 5 players to really have an interesting game and it runs very long.

19956,"When I saw this in stores, I always ignored it, assuming that a game based on a TV show was designed primarily to be fun for fans of the show (which I am not), at the expense of being fun for anyone else (which I am).

I have been pleasantly surprised.

I've only played a few games, but this game's loyalty system blows those in Shadows Over Camelot or Bang! out of the water.  Additionally, there is an interesting mix of character abilities, and the core skill check mechanic is fairly solid.

My complaints are simple and few: there is a disappointing lack of different strategy cards, and there is a significant range of power in the Crisis deck, making the luck-to-strategy ratio a bit high for my taste.

(Update) Unfortunately, going to downgrade this one from an 8 to a 7, as either we're hopelessly terrible at this game (but only some of us, sometimes) or this game is hopelessly imbalanced.  The part of me that likes to win is starting to get excited every time I see a ""You are a Cylon"" card, since I've basically been assured an easy victory.  However, the part of me that actually likes competitive games is starting to get a bit tired of this game.

(Update Update) We've been playing this with the recommended variant of ""Start the humans with 2 more of everything"", and it seems to do the trick (Maybe a little too much; we should try ""Start the humans with 1 more of everything"").

There was nothing like it that blended a thematic strategy game with traitor mechanics (at least that I'd played). Nowadays, this has gotten shelved for Dead of Winter since it's not as finicky about player counts and nobody cares about the show/theme anymore. Personally, I preferred the fact that we *knew* there were traitors somewhere once we passed the halfway point, which pushed us to point fingers at each other over every action, every twitch, every smile. In Dead of Winter, we look around the table anxiously, but it feels like a coop game first with a phenomenal traitor element smuggled in. Battlestar Galactica puts the traitor element in the front of everyone's mind, with some co-op mechanics involving blowing up frakkin' cylons and firing up the FTL to back it up.

I like how you've got a bit of player interaction in the sales and then a bit of navel-gazing in the tile placement.

-Everyone thought the game ended a round too soon. Several players mentioned that they would like one more round where all the bonuses scored.
-After playing at both 3 and 4 players, I think 3 is the ideal player count. With 4, it is too difficult to both consider your own strategy and get a sense of what other players need or guess what they will offer up.

It also has a smattering of Euro dice rolling that is just meh. The last game I played like this that comes readily for comparison's sake is Oracle of Delphi. And, yes, like OoD, you can mitigate your bad rolls.

Played a couple of times at 2 player, but at that player count, i'm going to say, it doesn't play as well as it could.
Played 4 player and enjoyed it. At this point, it felt like a race to try and gain money or fame as quickly as possible to win.  With the game ending when the two meet, it provides many ways of achieving this.
I originally went into this game thinking its a dice version of a worker placement, but  due to the fame track, its not about being the most efficient, but reaching the end point.  What i mean by this is that, typically, you are building an engine in order to generate greater and greater VP's, either through greater resources or taking more actions.
